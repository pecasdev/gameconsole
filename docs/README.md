This documentation is for the current version of the PES (Pecas Entertainment System). It includes an overview of the system design, a list of available libraries, and suggested best practices for development.

### What's the fastest way to learn everything?
Read the **ENTIRE** documentation from start to finish (no skimming!), there's not much and it should take you under 15 minutes to learn everything. Afterwards, look through the `published_injections` folder for examples. If you still have questions, contact me.

### How do I setup my development environment?
- Preferably use Windows. Everything should still work on Linux/Mac but I didn't test it.
- Install: VS Code, Docker, and Git
- Clone the PES repo locally
- In VS Code, navigate to the "Run and Debug" option on the sidebar (it should be the 4th icon) 
- Select the "Emulate" configuration and run it
- You should see a PyGame window pop up with the text "Emulation Successful" drawn inside the "screen" of the virtual PES
