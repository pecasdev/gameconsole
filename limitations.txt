stuff that doesn't exist:

Enum
match statement
most non-standard imports
string zfill

the emulator is slow by about 50-100ms, this shouldn't matter for most games but
for some games where reaction time is important, like the reaction, i can confirm it runs properly on the hardware

the emulator is currently broken for low tick rates cause it will drop inputs
if you're not currently holding a key when the next tick happens. should probably
fix this before you release lol

notes:
connect to VBUS from battery pack
all modules are powered from VSYS
